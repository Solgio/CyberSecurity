1) 365d38c60c4e98ca5ca6dbc02d396e53 ==> md5Cracker ==> password12345
    (With password salting, a random piece of data is added to the password before it runs through the hashing algorithm,
     making it unique and harder to crack. When using both hashing and salting, even if two users choose the same password,
     salting adds random characters to each password when the users enter them.)

2) bin(plain_text)^bin(decodeb64(encrypted_pl_text))=key
   bin(decode(encrypted_flag))^key=flag

3) Same dimention for current time and the 0x88 standard  (reverse XOR between standard time dimension and the final section of message of the same lenght)

      Once i have the key I can get the plain text easy (reverse XOR)
